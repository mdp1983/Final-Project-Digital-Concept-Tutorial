<h2>Resizing and File Size of Bitmapped Images:</h2>

<h4>Resizing Bitmapped Images:</h4>

<p>Bitmapped images can be resized, but you will sacrifice
    picture quality when doing so.  This is due to the images being
    made out of pixels. 
</p>

<h4>File Size:</h4>

<p>Bitmapped images take up more memory space in your program
    design.  Due to being made with pixels and not lines of code like
    Vector Images.
